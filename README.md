# Linear_Regression_Task2_GRIP

=> I have done  Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn which is a supervised learning model
=> Here we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions.
=> I have done on simple linear regression involving two variables.
=> In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.

# Steps performed

1) Importing all libraries that are required:
        Pandas 
        Numpy
        matplotlib.pyplot
2) Reading data from data set
        Here I used other resources URL to read dataset.      
3) Plot data on graph for finding linear relationship between Studying Hours and Percentage Score of Student.
4) Then we need to divide the data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs). 
5) Spliting data using Scikit-Learn's built-in train_test_split() method:
        Trainging Set
        Test Set 
6) Train the Algorithm
7) Predict the data in training set through graph for finding correctness.
        Here I plotted a regression line.
8) Compare Actual with Predicted
9) Evaluate  the model
